If the rules aren’t common knowledge, be ready to provide your professor with reference material for the rules. Gameplay constraints like turn order/timing, collision, timing, legal plays, etc. need to be enforced. The player should be able to win or lose. Depending on genre, this may include turn‑based decision‑making (cards, board games), pathing, movement, or attack selection (tower defense, wave‑based games), enemy spawning and behaviour logic (anything besides cards), NPC interactions (RPGs). Some form of basic, rules‑based AI is required.Your project must include a GUI. It should generally be clean and functional for an average person to use. It should be accessible (with mindfulness to contrast, readable text, and keyboard friendliness) and appropriate to the type of game. Your solution must somehow demonstrate the four pillars of OOP: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. It will very likely also use a library and collections in some way. The code should generally be well‑organized (e.g. use of regions, folders, and careful naming conventions). The code body should have comment headers on all human‑generated code files/classes and meaningful comments throughout. Documentation structures that lend themselves to better development and organization, such as docstrings in Python, Javadoc in Java, or XML. Comments in C# are strongly recommended. While a style guide is not prescribed in this course, the group should agree on a style guide and adhere to it. Your finished project should include some form of user guide or tutorial. This can take many forms including a separate document, a short video, or thorough inline help in the game. This should include how to play, a guide to the controls, and an explanation of any settings/options. GitHub – or an approved alternative – needs to be used for source control and collaboration. As well, a GitHub Project board or another Kanban tool is essential and should be referred to and maintained from at least Week 4 onward As noted previously, not every optional feature will make sense for every genre of game so choose options that are appropriate. Create a more advanced computer AI that would make alternate choices rather than the default strategy; something beyond strict rule adherence so that the opponents are more responsive, and more difficult to predict and defeat Either add distinct difficulty settings, or make it so that the game becomes harder (or easier) based on time, player actions, or progress. Create planned variation in the opponents the player can encounter. Perhaps they appear and behave differently. Note that this is not a suitable optional rule to select for an RPG since having a single enemy type would be silly. Make selectable variant rules to a well‑defined game, such as alternate cards (e.g. jokers in play, wildcards) or pieces, or different board layouts. Some game styles may lend themselves well to an endless mode, or a puzzle mode. Allow several player‑selectable UI or visual themes. Record and update the human player’s name and the number of games played, won, lost, or tied, in addition to the current streak (win, lose, or tie) / ratio. This should be persistent: meaning it needs to be saved in an external file and loaded each time the player plays the game again. An option for the player to reset the statistics should be made available. Allow for basic multiplayer gameplay between different players running the software on different devices. Students may propose their own optional feature, but it must be discussed with and approved by the professor no later than the end of Week 10 to ensure that its scope is suitable as an optional feature.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Core Gameplay","level":2,"id":"Core_Gameplay_0"},{"heading":"Character
